This repository contains code for an image steganography chrome extension. It was originally built as a final project for Harvard's CS 105 course. Here is a brief overview of each file's purpose:

popup.js: contains the main logic for the steganography algorithm

popup.html: builds the UI for the extension

background.js: defines the host website of the extension

manifest.json: necessary file for all chrome extensions. Contains metadata and permissions and links necessary scripts

styles.css: for css styling
